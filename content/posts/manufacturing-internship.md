### Custom Press Tooling & Prototyping
[cite_start]I modeled and prototyped early custom press tooling, using 3D printing to verify the design before committing to final machining[cite: 1, 2].
* [cite_start]**Technical Standards:** Drafted engineering drawings with precise tolerances (±.005) and SECTION A-A views to ensure assembly fit[cite: 6, 15, 19].


### Machined Metal Brackets
[cite_start]I created CAD files and SolidWorks drawings with precise dimensions, collaborating directly with machinists to ensure a proper fit within the larger assembly[cite: 47].

### SOP Optimization (Work Instructions)
[cite_start]I restructured and clarified existing Work Instructions (WI) to establish a new Rev. 0 baseline for shop floor operations[cite: 71, 72, 75].
* [cite_start]**Impact:** Simplified the machine shut-down process, providing clear visual steps for "Stop" and "Emergency Stop" procedures to improve operator safety[cite: 56, 57, 65, 68].

### Quality Assurance & Analysis
[cite_start]Conducted quality analysis on finished parts using a Cubic CNC Lathe and performed go-no go testing with height gages[cite: 48, 54].
* [cite_start]**Precision Analysis:** Identified "barely fail" scenarios (e.g., 3.2955) and analyzed injection molded parts against technical specifications[cite: 52, 53, 55].
